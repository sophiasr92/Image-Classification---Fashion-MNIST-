# Image-Classification---Fashion-MNIST-
#	Developed various deep neural network models by varying different hyperparameters to classify the 10 classes of images in FASHION MNIST dataset and compared the performance of each. 
#	Implemented the project in Python using Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow
#	Each of the models was developed by varying the hyperparameters and observed the performance of each model
